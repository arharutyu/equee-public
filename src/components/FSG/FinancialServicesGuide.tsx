                    You should also be aware that you must receive a Statement of Advice (SOA) and a Product Disclosure
                    Statement(s) when personal advice involving a financial product is provided to you, i.e. advice that
                    takes into consideration your personal objectives, financial position and needs. The SOA will
                    contain the advice, the basis on which it is given which may have influenced the advice and how
                    Lifestyle Investment Planning and your adviser will be remunerated for the advice we give you. If
                    your adviser provides further advice to you, but not in writing, and that further advice is related
                    to the advice provided in a previous SOA, that further advice will be recorded in a Record of Advice
                    (ROA). You may request an ROA from your adviser or Lifestyle Investment Planning up to seven years
                    after the further advice was provided, at no additional cost. In the event we make a recommendation
                    to acquire a particular financial product (other than securities), we must also provide you with a
                    Product Disclosure Statement containing information about the particular product’s risks, benefits,
                    features and costs to enable you to make an informed decision.

                    Your adviser acts on behalf of Lifestyle Investment Planning who is responsible for the advice
                    provided to you. However, your adviser may operate separate businesses, and provide other services
                    through those businesses, which are NOT authorised by Lifestyle Investment Planning and do NOT
                    involve Lifestyle Investment Planning in any way, such as: accounting, auditing, tax return
                    preparation, self-managed super fund compliance and administration, property sales and referrals,
                    and other products and activities. Lifestyle Investment Planning is NOT responsible for any advice

                    to appreciate that any benefits we receive – such as commission, corporate hospitality or marketing
                    support for example - may give rise to an actual or potential conflict of interest. However, where

                <p className="section-description">
                    Lifestyle Investment Planning advisers usually provide advice tailored to your individual
                    circumstances and also have the capacity to implement the advice they give, except where this may
                    require the use of other professionals (accountants and lawyers). You may choose to enter into an
                    agreement with your adviser to provide you with both initial advice and ongoing advice. If
                    appropriate, we may also provide general advice only, where you are ultimately responsible for
                    ensuring that this advice is suitable to your particular needs, objectives and financial situation.
                    In this case, you should also obtain any relevant product disclosure statements to assist in this
                    purpose.

                    Should I transfer investment monies to my adviser’s account?

                <p className="section-description">
                    No. Lifestyle Investment Planning does not allow advisers to receive your investment funds into
                    their own account or into any Lifestyle Investment Planning Pty Ltd account. You should only
                    transfer investment funds for a financial product to the approved financial institution that issues
                    the financial product (as specified in the Product Disclosure Statement or similar document). You
                    should never transfer investment funds to any other entity or person.

                <p className="section-description">
                    You should also not sign any
                    blank forms or appoint your adviser as your attorney (or authorised signatory). You should not
                    appoint any other person as your attorney or authorised signatory unless you have received legal
                    advice.

                <p className="section-description">
                    You will need to provide your adviser with your personal objectives and your current financial
                    situation including details of assets, liabilities, income and living expenses. This can best be
                    accomplished by completing a Lifestyle Investment Planning Client Data Form. The amount and type of
                    information we will require from you depends on what financial services you require.

                    financial situation.

                <p className="section-description">
                    You should read the warnings contained in the SOA, check any assumptions we
                    make and review the basis for our advice carefully before making a decision about whether to proceed
                    with the advice. You should also obtain and read any relevant product disclosure statements prior to
                    applying for a financial product.

                <p className="section-description">
                    All fees will be payable to a Lifestyle Investment Planning. If your adviser's remuneration includes
                    commission paid by a product provider, such commission payment will be made to a Lifestyle
                    Investment Planning. a Lifestyle Investment Planning retains between 0% and 50% of all commissions
                    and fees we receive. The remainder is passed on to your adviser.

                </h2>

                <p className="section-description">
                    The three stages of financial planning are Initial Advice, Implementation and Ongoing Reviews. There
                    is usually a separate fee for each of the three stages. Your adviser's remuneration structure for
                    each advice stage will be found in their Adviser Profile and the dollar value disclosed to you in
                    the SOA.

                <p className="section-description">
                    All commissions are payments made by the insurance product provider and are calculated as a
                    percentage of the premium paid on insurance products. Commissions are of two types: (a) upfront or
                    initial; and (b) ongoing or trail.
                </p>
                <p className="section-description">
                    Fees can be based on: a percentage of funds invested or funds
                    under advice, hourly rates multiplied by the hours worked, an agreed dollar amount for the value of
                    the specific service being performed, or a combination of these.
                </p>
                <p className="section-description">
                    The typical ranges of commission
                    and fee rates for investments and insurance products are as follows.
                </p>
                <p className="section-description">
                    Upfront fees can vary between
                    nil and 5.5% on investment products. Example: $100,000 invested in a wrap service may involve an
                    upfront fee payment of say 3% or $3,000 which could be deducted from your investment account and
                    paid to a Lifestyle Investment Planning, leaving a net investment of $97,000.
                </p>
                <p className="section-description">
                    Ongoing fees can be collected by platforms and other product providers and percentage-based fees can
                    be up to 2% pa, but normally in the range of 0.5% to 1.5% pa depending on the size of the portfolio.
                    Example: A
                    portfolio of $300,000 may be subject to an ongoing portfolio review fee of 1% per annum paid
                    quarterly. This would amount to $3,000 per annum.
